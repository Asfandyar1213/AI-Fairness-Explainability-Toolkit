# AI Fairness and Explainability Toolkit (AFET)

## üåü Overview

The AI Fairness and Explainability Toolkit (AFET) is an open-source platform designed to evaluate, visualize, and improve AI models with a focus on fairness, explainability, and ethical considerations. Unlike traditional benchmarking tools that focus primarily on performance metrics, AFET helps developers understand and mitigate bias, explain model decisions, and ensure ethical AI deployment.

## üéØ Mission

To democratize ethical AI development by providing tools that make fairness and explainability accessible to all developers, regardless of their expertise in ethics or advanced ML techniques.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Fairness Assessment**: Evaluate models across different demographic groups and identify potential biases
- **Explainability Tools**: Visualize and understand model decisions with various XAI techniques
- **Interactive Dashboards**: User-friendly interfaces for non-technical stakeholders to understand model behavior
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Implement techniques to reduce bias and improve fairness
- **Customizable Metrics**: Define your own fairness and explainability metrics
- **Model Comparison**: Compare different models across fairness and explainability dimensions
- **Documentation & Tutorials**: Comprehensive guides for ethical AI development

## üöÄ Why AFET?

1. **Beyond Performance**: While most tools focus on accuracy and speed, AFET emphasizes the ethical dimensions of AI
2. **Practical Application**: Bridges the gap between theoretical ethics and practical implementation
3. **Community-Driven**: Designed for contributions from diverse backgrounds - ML engineers, ethicists, domain experts, and more
4. **Production-Ready**: Tools that can be integrated into real-world ML pipelines

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core implementation language
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Support for major ML frameworks
- **Streamlit/Dash**: Interactive visualizations and dashboards
- **Scikit-learn**: Integration with traditional ML workflows
- **AIF360/Fairlearn**: Building on existing fairness libraries

## üìä Example Use Cases

- **Financial Services**: Ensure lending models don't discriminate against protected groups
- **Healthcare**: Validate that diagnostic models work equally well across different patient populations
- **Hiring**: Analyze resume screening algorithms for potential gender or racial bias
- **Criminal Justice**: Evaluate recidivism prediction models for fairness across demographics

## ü§ù How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're an ML expert, ethicist, UX designer, or documentation writer, there's a place for you in this project.

- **Code**: Implement new fairness metrics or explainability techniques
- **Documentation**: Improve guides, tutorials, and examples
- **Use Cases**: Share real-world applications and case studies
- **Testing**: Help ensure the toolkit works across different environments and scenarios
- **Design**: Improve the user experience and visualization components

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core fairness metrics and basic explainability tools
- **Phase 2**: Interactive dashboards and visualization components
- **Phase 3**: Advanced mitigation strategies and customizable metrics
- **Phase 4**: Integration with CI/CD pipelines and MLOps workflows
- **Phase 5**: Domain-specific extensions for healthcare, finance, etc.
